	abstract = {Evolution and diversification are inextricable intertwined with geography and ecology. The geographic landscape in which a taxon evolves can limit the environments in which it is found or provide opportunities for repeated range contraction and expansion through climate fluctuations. The presence (or absence) of regions with varying levels of climatic stability and the presence (or absence) of major biogeographic boundaries can shape the way in which species diversify or locally go extinct. In tandem with these geographic processes are ecological processes: taxa may interact with co-occurring taxa in the community, and can be limited by biotic barriers (such as disease) or develop specific biotic niches (such as commensalism). In this dissertation, I analyze biogeographic and ecologic drivers of avian evolution from the continental level to individual species interactions. I frame these issues hierarchically, starting with two chapters on large, broad scale patterns that affect not only birds but also mammals, and gradually focusing more and more finely on factors affecting avian systems. The latter part of the dissertation includes three ‘case studies’ of biogeographic dynamics, with one chapter on community-level dynamics, one on single-lineage diversification dynamics, and one on biogeographic dynamics within lineages that are ‘locked’ into a mimicry dynamic. Through this research, I demonstrate the ways in with biogeography, ecology, and the overlap between these aspects can drive diversification within avian systems},

	abstract = {Prevalence of impetigo (skin sores) remains high in remote Australian Aboriginal communities, Fiji, and other areas of socio-economic disadvantage. Skin sore infections, driven primarily in these settings by Group A Streptococcus (GAS) contribute substantially to the disease burden in these areas. Despite this, estimates for the force of infection, infectious period and basic reproductive ratio—all necessary for the construction of dynamic transmission models—have not been obtained. By utilising three datasets each containing longitudinal infection information on individuals, we estimate each of these epidemiologically important parameters. With an eye to future study design, we also quantify the optimal sampling intervals for obtaining information about these parameters. We verify the estimation method through a simulation estimation study, and test each dataset to ensure suitability to the estimation method. We find that the force of infection differs by population prevalence, and the infectious period is estimated to be between 12 and 20 days. We also find that optimal sampling interval depends on setting, with an optimal sampling interval between 9 and 11 days in a high prevalence setting, and 21 and 27 days for a lower prevalence setting. These estimates unlock future model-based investigations on the transmission dynamics of skin sores.},

	abstract = {Often in the study of behavioral ecology, and more widely in science, we require to statistically test whether the central tendencies (mean or median) of 2 groups are different from each other on the basis of samples of the 2 groups. In surveying recent issues of Behavioral Ecology (Volume 16, issues 1–5), I found that, of the 130 papers, 33 (25\%) used at least one statistical comparison of this sort. Three different tests were used to make this comparison: Student's t-test (67 occasions; 26 papers), Mann–Whitney U test (43 occasions; 21 papers), and the t-test for unequal variances (9 occasions; 4 papers). My aim in this forum article is to argue for the greater use of the last of these tests. The numbers just related suggest that this test is not commonly used. In my survey, I was able to identify tests described simply as “t-tests” with confidence as either a Student's t-test or an unequal variance t-test because the calculation of degrees of freedom from the 2 sample sizes is different for the 2 tests (see below). Hence, the neglect of the unequal variance t-test illustrated above is a real phenomenon and can be explained in several (nonexclusive ways) ways:Argument 4 relies on the central limit theorem and would require a combined sample size of at least 30 (Sokal and Rohlf 1987, p. 107); however, in my survey, the majority (47 out of 61) of tests for which sample sizes were provided had a combined sample size below 30. The fallacy of argument 3 has been demonstrated previously on several occasions (e.g., Kasuya 2001; Neuhauser 2002). To explore argument 1 further, imagine that we have 2 sample groups (labeled “1” and “2,” with means [μ1 and μ2], variances [{\textbackslash}batchmode {\textbackslash}documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amssymb\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsfonts\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsmath\} {\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\} {\textbackslash}begin\{document\} {\textbackslash}(s\_\{1\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}) {\textbackslash}end\{document\} and {\textbackslash}batchmode {\textbackslash}documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amssymb\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsfonts\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsmath\} {\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\} {\textbackslash}begin\{document\} {\textbackslash}(s\_\{2\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}) {\textbackslash}end\{document\}], and sample sizes [N1 and N2]).

Hence, we can see the need for the underlying assumption of equal population variances in this test. The Student's t-test performs badly when these variances are actually unequal, both in terms of Type I and Type II errors (Zar 1996). Figure 1 suggests that unequal sample variances are common in behavioral ecology. Although it is true that unequal variances are less problematic if sample sizes are similar, in practice, we often have quite unequal sample sizes (Figure 2). Hence, I suggest that the Student's t-test is frequently used in behavioral ecology when one of its important underlying assumptions is violated, and consequently, its performance is unreliable.},
