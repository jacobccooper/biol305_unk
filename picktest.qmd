## Picking the test

A major component of the final will be picking the correct test to run on some data. Here, I cover the specific ways in which you can determine what test to use.

Please use this web page as an *interactive* way to pick the test.

## Exceptions

Below is a walk through for the most common statistical analyses, but keep in mind there are a few "less common" ones that we are using as well:

-   **Binomial test** - if we are looking at something with discrete outcomes - like coin tosses, die rolls, etc. - we are doing a binomial test to determine the probability of a specific outcome. You can do this with `binom.test`.

-   **Poisson test** - if we are looking at the probability of obtaining certain counts over events - specifically, looking at the probability of *rare* events - we will use a Poisson. You can do this with `poisson.test`.

## Explanatory Variable

The explanatory variable is continuous and numeric. Pick this one for a continuous measurement variable, for example, such as Longitude, concentration, or other ratio or integer data.

The explanatory variable is discontinuous and categorical. In these cases, the explanatory variable is a condition, like a control and a treatment.

## Continuous explanatory variable

### Continuous response variable

If you have a continuous response variable, then you need to see what the question is asking:

-   **Is there a relationship?**

If you are looking at a problem and it is simply asking *if* there is a relationship, you are looking at a **correlation analysis**.

-   **What is the relationship?**

If you are asking *what* the relationship is or looking to be able to *predict* a value based on what you know, you are doing a **linear regression**. Note there are other kinds of regression, but in this class, we focus on linear regression.

If we have multiple response variables, we can do multiple regression, which we do not cover here.

### Discrete response variable

If you are looking at a discrete response variable, such as a state of 1 or 0 in response to a certain amount of stimulus, then you are doing a **logistic regression**. We did not cover this analysis in this class.

## Discrete explanatory variable

For discrete explanatory variables, we are often looking at categorical treatments or distinct groups, like species or geographic locations.

### Continuous response variable

For a continuous response variable, we need to ask ourselves how many categories we are dealing with.

-   If we are dealing with **two categories** or **two measurements from the same individual**, we are using a $t$**-test**.

Make sure you check the *t*-test page to understand what kind of *t*-test is being performed. For repeated measurements from the same individuals or populations under different conditions, we have the **paired *t*-test***.* Otherwise, we have the **Welch's *t*-test** as the default in *R*. *NOTE* that the default assumes unequal variance; you must set `var.equal = TRUE` to perform a **"true" *t*-test**. Make sure you familiarize yourself with *why* our code is assuming variances are unequal.

If we *know* what the population is, we will use a $Z$-score, but bear in mind that we will almost always use a $t$-test to account for error. A $t$-test with infinite degrees of freedom is the same as a $Z$-score, so it is better to default to a $t$-test.

-   If we have **three or more** **categories or treatments** then we need to perform an **ANOVA**.

If we are simply comparing multiple groups, we are performing a one-way ANOVA. We also need to make sure we aren't doing some sort of factorial ANOVA, repeated-measures ANOVA, or interactive ANOVA. Please read the ANOVA page to ensure you are using the correct format.

**Remember to label ANOVA plots with letters to indicate the separate groups**.

If we have multiple response variables, we can use a MANOVA; we do not cover that in this class.

### Discrete response variable

If our response variable *and* our explanatory variable are discrete (i.e., categorical or nominal), then we are doing a $\chi^2$ **test**. This tests looks at counts in different categories. For example, looking at proportions of men and women who do and do not smoke would be a classic $\chi^2$ test.
