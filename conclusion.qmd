## Parting thoughts

In this class, we have covered two major things: (1) the basics of statistics for biological research and (2) the basics of using *R* to solve different computational problems. It is my hope that this class helps you both become a better researcher and also a more efficient researcher and student by using code to help you with your future projects.

## ᏙᏓᏓᎪᎲᎢ

ᏙᏓᏓᎪᎲᎢ (pronounced *doh-dah-dah-go-huh-ee*) is a traditional Cherokee farewell. It does not mean goodbye, but rather reflects a parting of ways until a group of folks meet again.

I enjoyed getting to know all of you in class, and please feel free to reach out or stop by and say hi if you are ever passing through Kearney in the future or if you need help with something biology related.
