## Common Commands

The following are common useful commands used in *R*, with examples of their use.

-   `<-` / `=` - save a value as an object

```{r}
x <- 10
x
```

-   `c` - concatenate, place two values together

```{r}
x <- c(10,11)
x
```

## Basic statistics

For these examples, we will create a random vector of number to demonstrate how they work.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000)
```

-   `mean` - get the mean / average of a set of data

```{r}
mean(x)
```
