# Question 9.1

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# download La Selva data
laselva <- read_csv("https://zenodo.org/records/4979259/files/LaSelvaBirdTrendsDatatable.csv")
# isolate the big groundbirds
big_groundbirds <- laselva[1:6,]
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
#Test 1
bigyearsall <- chisq.test(big_groundbirds$NYears)
bigyearsall
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
bigyearsp <- bigyearsall$p.value
print(round(bigyearsp, 2))
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
#Test 2
bigmaxall <- chisq.test(big_groundbirds$MaxN)

```

## Part 1

We do not reject the null for different numbers of years being encountered ($\chi^2_{(5)} = 0.71, p = 0.98$).

## Part 2

We do reject the null for high counts ($\chi^2_{(5)} = 76.45, p < 0.0001$).

# Question 9.2

Null: There is no difference in traffic depending on time on the east sidewalk.
Null: There is no difference in traffic depending on time on the west sidewalk.
Null: There is no difference in traffic between east and west sidewalks. 

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
bicycles <- read_csv("https://zenodo.org/records/2648564/files/Fremont_Bridge_Hourly_Bicycle_Counts_by_Month_October_2012_to_present.csv")
bicycles <- bicycles |> 
  # convert to data frame
  as.data.frame() |> 
  # convert to date format
  mutate(Date = as.POSIXct(Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")) |> 
  #subset to March 30-31, 2019
  filter(year(Date) == 2019) |> 
  filter(month(Date) == 3) |> 
  filter(day(Date) == 30 | day(Date) == 31)
march_31 <- bicycles |> 
  filter(day(Date) == 31) |> 
  filter(hour(Date) > 7 & hour(Date) < 18)
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
#Eastbound
eastall <- chisq.test(march_31$`Fremont Bridge East Sidewalk`)
eastall
```

## Part 1

Eastbound traffic is not equally likely at all times of day ($\chi^2_{(9)} = 98.54, p < 0.0001$). We reject $H_0$.

## Part 2

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
#Westbound
westall <- chisq.test(march_31$`Fremont Bridge West Sidewalk`)
westall
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
print(round(westall$p.value, 4))
```

Westbound traffic is not equally likely at all times of day ($\chi^2_{(9)} = 106.81, p < 0.0001$). We reject $H_0$.

## Part 3: Method 1 (Table)

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
#Compared
table_dir <- rbind(East = march_31$`Fremont Bridge East Sidewalk`, 
                   West = march_31$`Fremont Bridge West Sidewalk`)
eastwestall <- chisq.test(table_dir, correct=FALSE)
eastwestall
```

Traffic at a particular time of day is equally likely between traffic directions ($\chi^2_{(9)}=3.24$, $p = 0.95$). We fail to reject $H_0$.

## Part 2: Method 2 (putting each separately)

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
chisq.test(march_31$`Fremont Bridge East Sidewalk`, march_31$`Fremont Bridge West Sidewalk`)
```

Traffic at a particular time of day is equally likely between traffic directions ($\chi^2_{(81)}=90$, $p = 0.23$). We fail to reject $H_0$.

# Question 9.3

## Method 1: Table

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
march_30 <- bicycles  |> 
  filter(day(Date) == 30, hour(Date) > 7 & hour(Date) < 18) |>
  select(-`Fremont Bridge West Sidewalk`) |>
  mutate(Date = hour(Date)) |>
  rename("March 30" = `Fremont Bridge East Sidewalk`)

march_31_east <- march_31 |>
  select(-`Fremont Bridge West Sidewalk`) |>
  mutate(Date = hour(Date)) |>
  rename("March 31" = `Fremont Bridge East Sidewalk`)

date_compare <- full_join(march_31_east, march_30, by = "Date") |>
  rename("Hour" = Date) |>
  arrange(Hour)

# Create table for chi-sq
date_table <- rbind(`March 31` = date_compare$`March 31`,
                    `March 30` = date_compare$`March 30`)

chisq_date <- chisq.test(date_table)
chisq_date
```

We fail to reject the null. There is no difference between days with respect to traffic ($\chi^2_{(9)}=3.93$, $p = 0.92$).

## Method 2: Listing values

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
chisq.test(date_compare$`March 31`, date_compare$`March 30`)
```

We fail to reject the null. There is no difference between days with respect to traffic ($\chi^2_{(72)}=80$, $p = 0.24$).
