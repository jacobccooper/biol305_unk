## Overview

For the homework this week, we were looking at *descriptive statistics* over large datasets. These help us get an idea of what the data are like. We required two packages to perform these analyses:

```{r}
# allows for internet downloading
library(curl)

# enables data management tools
library(tidyverse)
```

## Answer Key: Descriptive Statistics

For the homework, you were to create an *RMarkdown* document rendering as an `html` file. For the homework, we need to find the following values. Here, I indicate:

-   mean

    -   `mean`

<!-- -->

-   median

    -   `median` or `summary`

-   range

    -   distance between `min` and `max` values

-   interquartile range

    -   we can use `quantile` to find the 25th and 75th percentiles

-   variance

    -   `var`

-   standard deviation

    -   `sd`

-   coefficient of variation

    -   We can create a custom code to calculate this. Remember, $cv=\frac{\sigma}{\mu}$.

```{r}
cv <- function(x){
  sigma <- sd(x)
  mu <- mean(x)
  val <- sigma/mu
  return(val)
}
```

-   standard error

    -   We can create a custom code to calculate this. Remember, $se=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.

```{r}
se <- function(x){
  n <- length(x) # calculate n
  s <- sd(x) # calculate standard deviation
  se_val <- s/sqrt(n)
  return(se_val)
}
```

-   whether there are any "outliers"

    -   Values that are 1.5x the IQR and beyond

#### Keymaker

I have written a custom code to produce all of the above values, which I called `key_maker`.

```{r}
key_maker <- function(x, # specify data
                      roundval){ # specify rounding!
  
  # calcualte and print mean value
  print(paste0("Mean: ", round(mean(x),roundval)))
  
  # calcualte and print median value
  print(paste0("Median: ", round(median(x),roundval)))
  
  # calculate and print range
  # distance between min and max
  print(paste0("Range: ", round(max(x) - min(x),roundval)))
  
  # get IQRs, use method of book!
  quantiles_x <- quantile(x, type = 6) %>% as.numeric()
  # get 25th and 75th quantiles
  print(paste0("IQR: ",round(quantiles_x[4] - quantiles_x[2],roundval)))
  
  # calculate variance
  print(paste0("Variance: ",round(var(x),roundval)))
  
  # calculate standard deviation
  print(paste0("SD: ", round(sd(x),roundval)))
  
  # calculate coefficient of variation
  # use previously defined function
  print(paste0("CV: ",round(cv(x),roundval)))
  
  # calculate standard error
  # use previously defined function
  print(paste0("SE: ", round(se(x),roundval)))
  
  # calculate 25th quantile
  lowquant <- quantile(x,0.25,type = 6) %>% 
    as.numeric() # convert to numeric
  
  # calculate 75th quantile
  hiquant <- quantile(x,0.75,type = 6) %>% 
    as.numeric() # convert to numeric
  
  # get the IQR
  iqr <- hiquant - lowquant
  
  # calculate 1.5*IQR
  lowbound <- lowquant - (1.5*iqr)
  hibound <- hiquant + (1.5*iqr)
  
  # low outliers?
  # select elements that match
  # identify using logical "which"
  lows <- sum(x < lowbound)
  if(lows > 0){
    low.vals <- x[which(x < lowbound)]
    print("Low outlier(s): ")
    print(paste0(length(low.vals)," values found."))
    # only print if 75 or fewer vals
    if(lows <= 75){print(low.vals)}
  }else{print("No low outliers.")}
  
  # same procedure for high outliers
  highs <- sum(x > hibound)
  if(highs > 0){
    hi.vals <- x[which(x > hibound)]
    print("High outlier(s):")
    print(paste0(length(hi.vals)," values found."))
    # only print if 75 or fewer vals
    if(highs <= 75){print(hi.vals)}
  }else{print("No high outliers.")}
}
```

#### 1: UNK Nebraskans

Ever year, the university keeps track of where students are from. The following are data on the number of students admitted to [UNK from the state of Nebraska](https://www.unk.edu/factbook/index.php):

```{r}
# create dataset in R
nebraskans <- c(5056,5061,5276,5244,5209,
                5262,5466,5606,5508,5540,5614)

years <- 2023:2013

nebraskans_years <- cbind(years,nebraskans) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

nebraskans_years
```

Using these data, please calculate the mean, median, range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, standard error, and whether there are any "outliers" for the number of UNK students from Nebraska.

```{r}
key_maker(nebraskans_years$nebraskans, # data
          0) # rounding
```

**Synthesis question**: Do you think that there are any really anomalous years? Do you feel data are similar between years? *Note* we are not looking at trends through time but whether any years are outliers.

> Data appear to be similar between years. If looking directly at dataset, values are decreasing through time, but there are no major anomalies. **NOTE** values may seem weird because of rounding!

#### 2: Piracy in the Gulf of Guinea

The following is a dataset looking at oceanic conditions and other variables associated with pirate attacks within the region between 2010 and 2021 [@Moura2023]. Using these data, please calculate the mean, median, range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, standard error, and whether there are any "outliers" for distance from shore for each pirate attack (columns `Distance_from_Coast`).

```{r}
url_file <- curl("https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/42314604")
pirates <- url_file %>% read_csv()
```

```{r}
key_maker(pirates$Distance_from_Coast,
          2) # round to two decimal places!
```

> We have no low outliers but 50 high outliers. We have a very high variance and range.

**Synthesis question**: Do you notice any patterns in distance from shore? What may be responsible for these patterns? *Hint*: Think about what piracy entails and also what other columns are available as other variables in the above dataset.

> Most attacks are close to shore. We have no low bounds because we are very close to shore, and high bounds are the very distant attacks.

#### 3: Patient ages at presentation

The following is a dataset on skin sores in different communities in Australia and Oceania, specifically looking at the amount of time that passes between skin infections [@lydeamore_estimation_2020]. This file includes multiple different datasets, and focuses on data from children in the first five years of their life, on househould visits, and on data collected during targeted studies [@Lydeamore2020].

```{r}
url_file <- curl("https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007838.s006")

ages <- url_file %>% read_csv()
```

Let's see what this file is like real fast. We can use the command `dim` to see the `rows` and `columns`.

```{r}
dim(ages)
```

As you can see, this file has only two columns but 17,150 rows! For the column `time_difference`, please calculate the mean, median, range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, standard error, and whether there are any "outliers".

```{r}
key_maker(ages$time_difference,7)
```

**Synthesis question**: Folks will often think about probabilities of events being "low but never zero". What does that mean in the context of these data? What about these data make you feel like probabilities may decrease through time but never become zero?

> There is always a change of reoccurrence, as shown by the massive variance and range. However, reoccurrence almost always happens on a shorter time scale. We can never say with complete certainty that the chance of something is 0%.
